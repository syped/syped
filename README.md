Iâ€™m a full stack software engineer that grew up in New Jersey and have a background in the automotive technical field. As a person who spent my life around computers I found a career path where I can challenge my current abilities and continue to express my love of learning new technologies. I always tend to go out of my way to tackle difficult challenges and make sure the result of my work is perfect. 

On my free time I enjoy spending lots of time around my friends, playing lots of different games, the main one being Valorant and watching new animes or kdramas. I also love listening to pop/kpop music (shoutout to my fellow fearnots) and am listening to it 24/7.
